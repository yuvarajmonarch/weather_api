# 🌤️ Weather App

This is a responsive and feature-rich **Weather App** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**, powered by the **WeatherAPI**.

## 📚 What I Learned

I recently started learning how to **integrate APIs into HTML projects** through YouTube tutorials. It sparked my interest in building real-time, data-driven applications — especially those related to weather and environmental conditions.

## ⚙️ About the Project

This project was developed in just **7 minutes** with the help of **ChatGPT** and modern **AI tools**. It was a quick yet insightful experience where I explored:

- Real-time Weather API integration
- AQI (Air Quality Index) processing
- DOM manipulation with JS
- Responsive UI/UX design

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla)
- WeatherAPI

## 🤖 Credit

Special thanks to **ChatGPT** for speeding up the development process and helping me understand API handling with ease. AI-assisted development is a game-changer!
